It is vital in calculating the [weighted average cost of capital](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/what-is-wacc-formula/) (WACC), as CAPM computes the cost of equity. WACC is used extensively in [financial modeling](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/financial-modeling/what-is-financial-modeling/).  It can be used to find the net present value (NPV) of the future cash flows of an investment and to further calculate its [enterprise value](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/what-is-enterprise-value-ev/) and finally its equity value.")
